# Principles

## Setup: `start_here()`

Before using `starters` for the first time, run

```r
starters::start_here()
```

This function checks different aspects of your setup (git installation, gitconfig, `GITHUB_PAT`, `DESCRIPTION` default values, GitHub username guessing), that will help automatic steps later on. Most of these aspects are inspired from [`usethis` setup article](https://usethis.r-lib.org/articles/articles/usethis-setup.html). For each aspect, if your setup needs improvements an informative error message will be thrown so you might be able to know how to proceed.

## Best practice: Git, GitHub, Continuous Integration

By default, `starters` function encourage the combined use of Git, GitHub and Travis for version control, project sharing, continuous checks and deliveries. 

* We take the stance that you should be using source control and that the source control technology you should be using is [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Git-Basics). 
* For the most part, we expect your Git repositories to live on [GitHub](https://github.com). **To learn more about git and GitHub we recommend reading [Happy Git with R](https://happygitwithr.com/) by Jenny Bryan, the STAT 545 TAs, Jim Hester.**

* For continuous integration, we only support Travis at the moment, via the [`tic`](https://ropenscilabs.github.io/tic/) and [`travis`](https://ropenscilabs.github.io/travis/) packages. If you're new to Travis, read [Julia Silge's great intro](https://juliasilge.com/blog/beginners-guide-to-travis/), and create a Travis account linked to your GitHub account.

_You can opt out of git by setting the `git` argument of `starters` function to `FALSE`, and of GitHub as well as Travis by setting their `external_setup` argument to `NULL`_

When the project is created all the template aspects will be committed to source control, such that you could import the project into GitHub, or use the command line to push it to GitHub.

As all the projects are created with an RStudio project, you should be able to work with the source control aspects within RStudio. You can also use your preferred shell or GUI to interact with it.


## Camel or snake?

All project-creating functions in `starters` have both a snake case name, and a lower camel case name (for historical reasons). E.g. `create_basic_project()` (snake case) used to be named `createBasicProject()` (lower camel case). One can use any of these names to call the functions.

# `create_basic_project()` and its extensions

## Basic projects

A basic project that's created with `create_basic_project()` is the fundamental building block for various flavours of projects you might build with `starters`. 
A basic project contains a minimal package structure to allow you an easy way to:

 - make functions for use within your work
 - list packages needed for easy dependency management
 - build your outputs using mechanisms aimed at packages
 
All basic projects contain:

* a DESCRIPTION file
* an `R/` directory
* an RStudio project file
* a README.Rmd. A README is a wonderful introduction to your project and it's the first thing people see when they look at it on GitHub. We will create a README.Rmd so that you can write R Markdown and produce a README.md suitable for GitHub. This enables you to show off your functions, your test results, etc. In the README created, there will be a [repostatus.org badge indicating the status of your project](https://www.repostatus.org/). By default the initial status is WIP, change it via the `initial_status` argument. 

### Optional extras
We take the opinion that your project should feature the following things by default but they can always be turned off by using the parameters in the creation of a project.



#### External setup

`create_basic_project()` will by default help setting up your project on both 
GitHub (Git platform) and Travis (for continuous integration). If you want to 
opt out of those, use `external_setup = NULL`. By default, the `external_setup` argument is a named list,

```r
external_setup = list(
                     git_service = "GitHub",
                     login = gh::gh_whoami()$login,
                     private = FALSE,
                     protocol = "ssh",
                     ci_activation = "travis",
                     project_type = "basic",
                               )
```                  



##### GitHub

GitHub is the only supported Git platform at the moment. A GitHub repo of the same name as the project will be created. Its description will use the `title` 
argument of the `create_basic_project()` function. The account used will be 
the one provided as `login`, if none is provided `gh::gh_whoami()$login`. You can opt out of "ssh" in favour of "https" via the `git_protocol` element of the `external_setup` argument.

##### Travis
[Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/) is a free continuous integration tool that allows projects from GitHub to be checked in a clean environment and for further actions to be taken if the project doesn't have any errors. This is great for checking out your packages work, but it's also a really useful utility for analysis and training projects as you can use it to build your reproducible documentation and host it for free on GitHub.

The basic project contains a [`.travis.yml` file](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/customizing-the-build), which holds instructions for Travis. It won't interfere in any way with your development process, and to fully enable Travis you need to [turn on Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/getting_started) for the package.

#### Reproducibility
A problem with programming using other people's code is that other people's code changes. This risks your results changing over time. To prevent this, there are some R packages which can help us address this.

[`packrat`](https://rstudio.github.io/packrat/) will build a manifest of package versions based on what you use at the point of production. It will then ensure people use the Packrat defined packages, instead of whatever version they have installed.

[`checkpoint`](https://rdrr.io/cran/checkpoint) moves away from using your default CRAN repository and points to a specific repository that has daily snapshots. You then work with CRAN as of a specific date (by default the date you created the project). This is lighter weight than `packrat` but does not help with non-CRAN packages.

## Analysis projects

Analysis projects are projects where you perform some analysis and probably produce some outputs. The function `create_analysis_project()` aims to facilitate your analysis by setting up a best practices template project.

At the moment, this facility will set up a basic project with some additional folders:

- data
- analysis
- outputs

### Travis

By default, these projects' tic.R will knit the R Markdown files contained in analysis/ and deploy them to a gh-pages branch. Note that GitHub pages websites are public

## Training projects

Training projects are projects where you need to produce materials for others and/or to produce slides. The function `create_training_project()` aims to facilitate your training projects by setting up a best practices template project.

At the moment, this facility will set up a basic project with some additional folders:

- data
- handouts
- slides

### Travis

By default, these projects' tic.R will knit the R Markdown files contained in handouts/ and slides/ and deploy them to a gh-pages branch. Note that GitHub pages websites are public.

### Packages used to document 

If you make a `handouts/` or `slides/` directory (both of which are created with the defaults), we will add `rmarkdown` to the project's DESCRIPTION file. 

You can specify an alternative package for your handouts via `handoutEngine`. At present, two additional package options are supported. The first is [`bookdown`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=bookdown), and the second is [`tufte`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=tufte). If you select `bookdown` or `tufte` as the `handoutEngine`, the relevant package will be added to the DESCRIPTION file and the demo files for this handout format will be added to the `handouts/` directory.

You can also specify an alternative package for your slides via `slideEngine`. The currently supported (most popular) package options are [`revealjs`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=revealjs) and [`xaringan`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=xaringan). Note also that the default `slideEngine` option (`rmarkdown`) caters for a number of additional R Markdown presentation formats such as `io_slides`, `slidy`, and `beamer` since these formats do not have additional package dependencies (although in the case of `beamer`, you'll need to have `TeX` installed). If you are using RStudio, you can find R Markdown templates for these presentation formats by going to File -> New File -> R Markdown -> Presentation.

If the `packrat` argument is not supplied or is set to `TRUE`, we will update the packrat manifest so that the packages are available when you open the project.


## Make your own
We think `create_basic_project()` provides a strong foundation for creating project templates.

To use it as a base for your own internal functions, you will need to import the package and then do something like this as a function wrapper:

```{r}
create_analysis_project <- function(name,
                                  dirs = c("data", "analysis", "outputs"),
                                  ...) {
  create_basic_project(name, ...)
  createdirs(name, dirs)
  invisible(TRUE)
}

```
