# starters 0.0.2

* New `start_here()` function checking and helping system setup and config for an optimal package development experience, based on [`usethis` setup article](https://usethis.r-lib.org/articles/articles/usethis-setup.html).

* Renamed the package `starters` because a package called `projects` was released on CRAN.

# pRojects 0.0.1.9003

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
